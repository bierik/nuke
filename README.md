Visualisation project for FHNW

# Prerequisite

 * node@9.9.0
 * yarn@1.3.2
 * Editor with eslint support (recommended)

# Getting started

Install dependencies using yarn:

``` bash
yarn
```

Run app using webpack devserver:

``` bash
yarn serve
```

This will open a server on `localhot:8080` by default running the application.

Build application for production:

``` bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `index.html`, `main.css`, `main.js` file which can be served
over a web server in production.
